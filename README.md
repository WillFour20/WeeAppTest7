WeeAppTest7
===========

Example notification center widget for iOS 7.

Screenshots attached show what it looks like in the notification center and in the notification center settings pane.

Requires the CustomWidgetIcons plugin to show the correct icon and display name in the notification center.
Otherwise the icon and name of the app specified in the AppBundleID key of Info.plist will be displayed instead.
